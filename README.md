## Hi there 👋

* In love with data analytics, digital marketing, science fiction and fantasy. Daydreams of invading aliens, zombies, dragons and unicorns. 😌
* Amateur astronomer, digital illustrator and graphic designer. She is learning stop-motion animation to make her stories more engaging. 
* Artificial intelligence enthusiast. She finds talking to machines more relaxing than talking to people. When she finishes her studies, she wants to take over the world. Plan B is to be on the side of the robots when they take over the world. 
* She can talk to cats, but this is not a track record, just a purrfect communication skill. 🐱
